# Kill-Bill--2D-game (Android App)
This is a basic android game created using Java and XML.
The App has Two Activities:
Main Activity - which is the default activity when the game starts.
Game Activity -  controls the flow of the entire game  . This activity does not have a layout .xml file , as we are extending 
the Surface View class to bring the animation effect. (due to the rapid change of contents on the screen) .
I have tried to make use of OOP's concepts such as Inheritence and Abstraction wherever possible by making classes for the major functionality of the
bird , flight and the bullet. 
Each of the above classes can be dealt with seperaltely and treated as a single abstract entity .
Moreover, I used methods wherever required to avoid code duplication and enhance program maintenance and reusability.
